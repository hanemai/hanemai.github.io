            <tr>
                <td>Class Sizes</td>
                <td>After having both small and large class sizes, <br>
                    I prefer smaller ones since they let the students <br>
                    interact more personal and the teacher is usually easier <br>
                    to ask questions.
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Friends</td>
                <td>It's fun to hang out and school is the place where <br>
                    we all come to everyday and get to see each other or <br>
                    have classes with each other. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Middle Band</td>
                <td>I like how there's free time so you can interact <br>
                    with other people and have plenty of time to do homework <br>
                    or ask teachers questions. Plus, it's easier to go to clubs.

    <p>Some other things I like about EPS are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The teachers, they're always understanding and fun.</li>
        <li>The pasta is so good.</li>
        <li>The start time.</li>
        <li>The learning enviroment.</li>
        <li>The maker space and provided recourses. </li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <p>However, some I dislike about EPS are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There isn't a huge variety of classes like Home <br>
            Economics like other schools have.
        </li>
        <li>No language options besides Spanish.</li>
        <li>That the ciriculum has alot of discussions <br>
            instead of the tons of writing in my old school.
        </li>
    </ul>
