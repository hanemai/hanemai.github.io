        <p class="medium-text Moon">Tofu is my adorable dog who is named after the white food she looks like
            (although her
            tail resembles a crisp marshmallow more).
        </p>
        <p class="medium-text Moon">She's really friendly and energetic when it comes to meeting other pets.
            When meeting
            humans, she's a bit more skiddish.

            <h3><u>Here are some of Tofu's likes and dislikes:</u></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chasing rabbits and squirrels. (Jindos are originally hunting dogs so she enjoys chasing prey.)</li>
                <li>Other dogs. (She loves playing tag with other dogs specifically.)</li>
                <li>Chewing toys. (She doesn't usually, but when she does, she often chews her toys instead of playing
                    normally.)</li>
                <li>Sleeping on chairs. (She always jumps up onto the couch or chair to sleep.)</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <ul>
                <li>Too short or too long walks. (It has to be just right, around an hour to two hours.)
                </li>
                <li>Strangers IN HOUSE. (Originally a hunting dog, jindos are generally protective and Tofu often
                    acts
                    like a guard dog, barking at any strangers in the house. She's more docile outside with strangers.)
                </li>
                <li>That the ciriculum has alot of discussions <br>
                    instead of the tons of writing in my old school.
                </li>
